hackathon
=========
This is a reposity that I will push to in the next few months, during which I will force myself push a few codes everyday.
I called the whole process 'hackathon' which is inspired by https://github.com/geekan.
The code contained here maybe be very cluttered, which basically just my practicing material :)
